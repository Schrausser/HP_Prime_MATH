 abstract = {A pair of asymmetric coefficients is introduced which are appropriate for measuring the association in ordered contingency tables. Earlier statistical methods are reviewed, and the new coefficients are shown to be closely related to both Kendall's tau-b and to Goodman and Kruskal's gamma, as well as the commonly used "percentage-difference." They are also shown to have a operational interpretation (in the Goodman-Kruskal sense). Their utility in both square and non-square contingency tables is discussed, as well as the way they may be interpreted as ordinal analogues of the traditional regression coefficients.},
